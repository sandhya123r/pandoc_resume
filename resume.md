Experience
----------
**Senior Member of Technical Staff, Oracle Inc.**, 2011-2015\
Oracle ACFS support for databases - ASM cluster file system

* Built a C/C++ based test application to test sparse files on ACFS that
  starts a multiprocess/multi-threaded workload to create sparse files,
  test various types of I/O on holes and data blocks.

* Worked on developing stress tests for storing database files on Oracle ACFS.
  Designed and implemented test framework based on PL/SQL, SQL, shell scripts
  for different types of database workload generation covering data mining
  (using STAR schema,ETL,OLTP/OLAP,securefiles LOBs) and comprehensive testing
  of features across Oracle RDBMS, including data layer, recovery and backup,
  query execution and optimisation, filesystem throughput across various
  operating systems - Linux, Solaris, AIX, Windows

* Developed C++ extension stress test for ACFS plugins to calculate filesystem
  metrics using OOPS paradigm

Stress, Performance, Destructive Testing for Oracle 11g, 12c.

* Design/Development/Execution of multi-tier stress test suites simulating
  real-world customer scenarios to uncover Product defects and enhance product
  quality. Architect large-scale, high-load,massively concurrent end-to-end
  test applications to assess Oracle Database’s scalability, reliability,
  availability and performance.

[Exadata](https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/index.html)

* Worked on stress and performance testing of bundle patches for Exadata,
  ACFS support on Exadata, WBFC (write back flash cache) support for ACFS on
  Exadata, EHCC(Exadata Hybrid Columnar Compression) support for ACFS on
  Exadata, sparse diskgroups to store datafiles on Exadata.

* Cross functional testing of multitenant container databases (CDB),
  In-Memory,Compression, Data Guard, RAC, ASM on ACFS/Exadata

* RDS testing to measure database throughput on Exadata clusters.

Projects
------------

Compliance Manager for the cloud (Oct’2015 - present)

  detections with respect to cloud security standards, alerting and
  recommendation engine for deviations, visualizing the compliance status
  based on roles. Implemented with AWS for the cloud, spark for the database,
  python for framework and D3 for the UI.
 
Priority-Based Flow control for Data Center Networks (Sep’2015-Present)
