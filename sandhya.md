Experience
----------
**Software Development Engineer Intern, Amazon Web Services**, Summer 2016\
Elastic transcoding team

**Senior Member of Technical Staff, Oracle Inc.**, 2011-2015\
Oracle ACFS support for databases - ASM cluster file system

* Built a C/C++ based test application to test sparse files on ACFS that
  starts a multiprocess/multi-threaded workload to create sparse files,
  test various types of I/O on holes and data blocks.

* Worked on developing stress tests for storing database files on Oracle ACFS.
  Designed and implemented test framework based on PL/SQL, SQL, shell scripts
  for different types of database workload generation covering data mining
  (using STAR schema,ETL,OLTP/OLAP,securefiles LOBs) and comprehensive testing
  of features across Oracle RDBMS, including data layer, recovery and backup,
  query execution and optimisation, filesystem throughput across various
  operating systems - Linux, Solaris, AIX, Windows

* Developed C++ extension stress test for ACFS plugins to calculate filesystem
  metrics using OOPS paradigm

Stress, Performance, Destructive Testing for Oracle 11g, 12c.

* Design/Development/Execution of multi-tier stress test suites simulating
  real-world customer scenarios to uncover Product defects and enhance product
  quality. Architect large-scale, high-load,massively concurrent end-to-end
  test applications to assess Oracle Database’s scalability, reliability,
  availability and performance.

[Exadata](https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/index.html)

* Worked on stress and performance testing of bundle patches for Exadata,
  ACFS support on Exadata, WBFC (write back flash cache) support for ACFS on
  Exadata, EHCC(Exadata Hybrid Columnar Compression) support for ACFS on
  Exadata, sparse diskgroups to store datafiles on Exadata.

* Cross functional testing of multitenant container databases (CDB),
  In-Memory,Compression, Data Guard, RAC, ASM on ACFS/Exadata

* RDS testing to measure database throughput on Exadata clusters.

Projects
------------

[Pi Cloud](https://gitlab.com/picloud/picloud) (Spring '16)

* Pi Cloud is a Raspberry Pi-based PaaS service(written in Python) that can
  add or remove nodes in real-time without restarting the server. It features
  a controller that can register new nodes, deploy applications on-demand given
  a github repository, and load balance traffic to the applications it manages
  and deploys, and implement CI/CD for these applications.   
Technologies - Python, REST Server via Flask, Fabric.

Mini Key/Value NoSQL Database (Spring '16)

* Extended an existing key/value database store written in Java (ShoreDB).
  Implemented a N-node instance of the database that exposes REST API calls to the
  user that map to CRUD operations. Built a prototype of highly available, scalable
  system using Elastic Load Balancer, VPC for hosting the application and database
  servers. Demonstrated availability in the face of partition, [ie AP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sNSWjt8or0).
  Also implemented [indexing for searching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cunSo8T7aKs)
  through records.   
Technologies - AWS, Java, Spring framework.

[e-Shopping Cart Prototype](https://github.com/sandhya123r/heroku-shoppingcart) (Spring '16)

* Built a scalable shopping cart service on Amazon Cloud and Heroku. Implemented
  session management using Redis, product catalog using MongoDB, and Express framework
  for the frontend. Backend consists of N-node instance of application server connecting
  to MySQL database.      
Technologies - AWS, Express, Redis , MongoDB, Spring, MySQL, Heroku. 

[Photo Gallery Application](https://github.com/sandhya123r/CMPE207-PhotoGallery) (Spring '16)

* Built a Photo Gallery web application. Application server focusses on concurrency
  design, high availability and scalability. Used MySQL for implementing replication
  and Django for the full stack consisting of static files, application server and
  REST interface. Monitored AWS resources using Cloudwatch.    
Technologies - Django, MySQL.

Compliance Manager for the cloud (Fall ’15)

* Real time management of compliances for cloud environment and deviation
  detections with respect to cloud security standards, alerting and
  recommendation engine for deviations, visualizing the compliance status
  based on roles. Implemented with AWS for the cloud, spark for the database,
  python for framework and D3 for the UI.
 
Priority-Based Flow control for Data Center Networks (Fall ’15)

* Research study on PFC, PAUSE frames, Ethernet network congestion control
  mechanism and usage of PFC in Data  centers.
